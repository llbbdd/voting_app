Dynamic Web Application Projects 01 - Build a Voting App

These are the given user stories:

Unauthenticated users can
  * See and vote on everyone's polls.
  * See the results of polls in chart form.
  
Authenticated users can
  * Keep their polls and come back later to access them.
  * Share their polls with friends.
  * See the aggregate results of polls.
  * Delete unwanted polls.
  * Create a poll with any number of possible items.
  * Can see and vote on everyone's polls.
  * See the results of polls in chart form.
  * Create a new option within an existing poll.
  
The app uses the Clementine.js framework along with the following packages:

  * "body-parser" - Makes incoming request bodies available under the req.body property.
  * "connect-ensure-login" - Ensures that the user is logged in.
  * "cookie-parser" - Maintains login across pages
  * "ejs" - Used to build non-interactive pages on server
  * "express" - Web framework for routing, etc
  * "express-session": - Session middleware
  * "mongodb" - Document-oriented database for poll and user login data
  * "passport" - User authentication
  
All user stories are fulfilled. I would have liked to add the following features but have had to draw a line underneath this particular project to move onto the next:

User input is validated as far as stopping user inputs that will cause errors, but there is no feedback to inform the user why the form has not been submitted.

I may or may not come back to this as my skills develop but it's more likely I will focus on upcoming challenges. Any feedback or criticism is welcome.
